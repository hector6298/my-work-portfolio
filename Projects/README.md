## Projects

This is some of the projects I have done, excluding publications and the graduation project. 

## Community Service

- **Hamilton Tech, Computer Science Club**: This project was carried out to motivate middle school students from rural areas of Ecuador to study fields related to computer science. This project was carried out from April to July of 2021. It includes a series of lectures, infographics, slides, and other material for the students to learn about this field.
