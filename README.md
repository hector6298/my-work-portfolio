# Twitter Spark Streaming

Development of an streaming application to listen to data from twitter, transform it with spark-streaming and store on a delta lake table
- Producer: Python scripts for specification of the objects and the actual script for producer initialization.
- Consumer: Scala Scripts for data ingestrion and transformation.

# Vision Vanishing Points

Uses object detection with CNNs and classical image processing algorithms to find lines to compute vanishing points. These vanishing points will be used to estimate horizon line.
