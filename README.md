# Code Samples
This is a repository of code samples from past projects, experiments, and so forth.
This repo contains code about the following subjects:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Performs visualizations from multiple variables from yelp fake reviews dataset, for further feature engineering.
    
- **Image Segmentation**: Development of a Convolutional Neural Network that learns to segment sculpture images.

- **Image Classification**: Training and testing of a Convolutional Neural Network for multi-class classification of Pneumonia, COVID-19 and normal chest x-ray images.

- **Object Keypoints Estimation**: CNN that tries to estimate keypoints from a car dataset.
- **NLP Text Classification**: Text classification using neural networks.
    - Hate speech classification using Transformers.
    - COVID-19 fake news detection using Doc2Vec, manual features and classical ML models.
- **Twitter Spark Streaming**: Development of an streaming application to listen to data from twitter, transform it with spark-streaming and store on a delta lake table
    - Producer: Python scripts for specification of the objects and the actual script for producer initialization.
    - Consumer: Scala Scripts for data ingestrion and transformation.
- **Vision Vanishing Points**: Uses object detection with CNNs and classical image processing algorithms to find lines to compute vanishing points. These vanishing points will be used to estimate horizon line.
